Recent advances in materials with non-trivial electronic topology have opened new pathways for rapid, low-energy switching that could revolutionize data storage and processing beyond the standard CMOS logic gate. LEAP aims to develop the first agentic AI system that incorporates theory, experiment, and literature to accelerate the discovery of novel switching mechanisms in topological materials. By employing physics-informed AI to accelerate next-generation topological platforms, LEAP seeks to enable transformative reductions in power consumption and pave the way toward truly scalable, energy-efficient “AI-at-scale”.
